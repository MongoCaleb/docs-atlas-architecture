When deploying your database, you have 2 main choices. The following diagram 
shows these options, which are explained further below:

:ref:`Single-Region Deployment<arch-center-paradigms-single>`

This is the simplest deployment option. In a single-region deployment, your 
data is stored in one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2`` 
or Google's ``asia-northeast3``). With this simplicity and lower cost comes 
the risk of lower availability and potentially lower latency, depending on the 
distribution of your application's users. {+service+} always provides a 
minimum of zone-level availability, which means that within a single region, if 
a single zone fails, your data is still available in the other zones.

:ref:`Multi-Region Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`

This deployment paradigm provides a more robust option with higher availability. 
There are several types of multi-region deployments:

- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by a *single* cloud provider 
  within a single "geography" (large areas like a continent or countries). 
  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the United States and are managed by the same cloud 
  provider. This ensures availability if any given region fails.

- Deploying clusters to one or more regions in two or more geographies. 
  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the United States, and a third cluster in ``eu-2``, 
  which is in Europe. This ensures availability if any given region fails, or 
  if an entire geographic area is unavailable.
  
- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by *multiple* cloud providers. 
  For example, you deploy clusters in the AWS region ``us-west-1`` and the GCP 
  region ``us-east4``. This provides the highest level of availability, ensuring 
  your data is available even if an entire cloud provider fails. 

- Global Clusters. This option should be considered for only the most complex 
  situations; for example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or 
  where legal terms dictate specific hosting requirements.
