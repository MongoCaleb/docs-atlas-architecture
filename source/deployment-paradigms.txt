When deploying your database, you have 3 main choices:

**:ref:`Single-Region Deployment<arch-center-paradigms-single>`**

This is the simplest deployment option. In a single-region deployment, your 
data is stored in one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2`` 
or Google's ``asia-northeast3``).

**:ref:`Multi-Region Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`**

This deployment paradigm provides a more robust option with higher availability. 
There are several types of multi-region deployments:

- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by a _single_ cloud provider 
  within a single "geography" (large areas like a continent or countries).

  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the Unites States and are managed by the same cloud 
  provider.

- Deploying clusters to one or more regions in two or more geographies.

  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the Unites States, and a third cluster in ``eu-2``, 
  which is in the Europe geography. 
  
- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by _multiple_ cloud providers.

  For example, you deploy clusters in the AWS region ``us-west-1`` and the GCP 
  region ``us-east4``.
  
**:ref:`Global Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-global>`**

  This option should be considered for only the most complex situations; for 
  example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or where legal terms 
  dictate specific hosting requirements.

The following diagram shows these options:

.. note::

   To ensure the highest availability of your applications, you should consider 
   your deployment strategy for your entire application stack, not just the 
   database. If your database deployment is configured for highest availability 
   in one region, but the app runs on the other side of the globe, you may not 
   realize the full benefits of your database deployment.
