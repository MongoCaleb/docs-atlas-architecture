When deploying your database, you have 3 main choices. The following diagram 
shows these options, which are explained further below:

:ref:`Single-Region Deployment<arch-center-paradigms-single>`

This is the simplest deployment option. In a single-region deployment, your 
data is stored in one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2`` 
or Google's ``asia-northeast3``). With this simplicity and lower cost comes 
the risk of lower availability and potentially lower latency, depending on the 
distribution of your application's users.

:ref:`Multi-Region Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`

This deployment paradigm provides a more robust option with higher availability. 
There are several types of multi-region deployments:

- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by a _single_ cloud provider 
  within a single "geography" (large areas like a continent or countries). 
  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the United States and are managed by the same cloud 
  provider.

- Deploying clusters to one or more regions in two or more geographies. 
  For example, you deploy clusters in regions called ``us-1`` and ``us-3``, 
  both of which are in the United States, and a third cluster in ``eu-2``, 
  which is in Europe. 
  
- Deploying clusters to multiple regions hosted by _multiple_ cloud providers. 
  For example, you deploy clusters in the AWS region ``us-west-1`` and the GCP 
  region ``us-east4``.


:ref:`Global Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-global>`

This option should be considered for only the most complex situations; for 
example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or where legal terms 
dictate specific hosting requirements.
