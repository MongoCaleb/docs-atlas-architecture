When deploying your database, you have 3 main choices, listed here by their 
relative complexity:

- A :ref:`single-region deployment <arch-center-paradigms-single>`, in which 
  your data is stored one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2``).
- A multi-region deployment, in which you have data in at least one region in 
  multiple "geographies" (continents or large countries). A minimal example 
  is having your data in one region in the Europe geography and one in the Asia 
  Pacific geography. A more robust example of a multi-region deployment is 
  having clusters in 3 Asia-Pacific regions, one European region, and 3 US 
  regions.
- A Global deployment. This option exists for the most complex situations; for 
  example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or where legal terms 
  dictate specific hosting requirements.

The following diagram shows these options:

.. note::

   To ensure the highest availability of your applications, you should consider 
   your deployment strategy for your entire application stack, not just the 
   database. If your database deployment is configured for highest availability 
   in one region, but the app runs on the other side of the globe, you may not 
   realize the full benefits of your database deployment.
