Single-region {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} nodes within
a single region of one cloud provider. Single-region {+service+}
deployments are supported on all {+cluster+} tiers. They provide 
a less expensive option for non-mission-critical deployments and for 
applications that have a geographically-similar user base.

Some providers' regions support availability zones within a region, which add 
protection in the case of a single zone outage. The provider automatically 
reroutes traffic to a node in another availability zone within the region to 
ensure availability. This is similar to multi-regional deployments but on a smaller 
scale.

The following diagram shows a single-region {+service+}
deployment for a region that has 3 availability zones:

:atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>` in the
{+service+} documentation.


Use Cases for Single-Region Deployments
---------------------------------------

Single-region deployments are best for the following use
cases:

Region-Specific Applications that Require Low Latency and Zonal High Availability (One Cloud Provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve performance for critical operations,
all {+service+} deployments allow you to deploy data
close to your users' geographic location, which reduces latency.
You can configure a single-region deployment for
high availability across zones and low latency.

A single-region deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use one cloud provider
- You want to deploy to more than one availability zone for high
  availability, and you don't need to deploy to more than one region
- Your application requires low latency *and* has a majority of users
  in one geographic location, since single-region deployments allow you
  to choose your geographic area.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| with
users primarily located in the eastern US, you can deploy a 
single-region deployment to ``us-east-1`` 
(a region that supports availability zones). This
ensures low latency since all nodes are within the eastern US, while
offering high availability if there's a zonal outage that affects the
primary node.

If your application requires low latency and
cross-region or cross-provider high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region` or :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`, respectively.

If your application requires low latency for users in any region across
a global user base, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-global`.

Applications that Require Data Sovereignty and Zonal High Availability (One Cloud Provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For compliance with data residency laws, data can be partitioned to
reside in a specific region, ensuring adherence to local regulations.
You can configure a single-region deployment for
high zonal availability and data sovereignty.

A single-region deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use one cloud provider
- You want to deploy to more than one availability zone for high
  availability, and you don't need to deploy to more than one region
- Your application requires data sovereignty, since single-region
  deployments allow you to choose your geographic area.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| that
requires data storage in Europe, you can deploy a single-region
deployment to a region within the EU (such as
``eu-west-1``, a region that supports availability zones). This
ensures data sovereignty since the region is within the EU, while
offering high availability if there's a zonal outage that affects the
primary node.

If your application requires data sovereignty and
cross-region or cross-provider high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region` or :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`, respectively.

Considerations for Single-Region Deployments
--------------------------------------------

Other considerations for single-region deployments include:

- High availability depends on the deployment of nodes across
  regions as well as the number, distribution, and priority order of
  nodes. To learn more about recommended
  {+cluster+} topologies for high availability, see
  :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.

For more considerations, see 
:atlas:`Considerations 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#considerations>` in the
{+service+} documentation.
