Multi-region {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} nodes across
multiple regions (as defined by the cloud providers). Multi-region
deployments enhance protection in the case of a :ref:`regional outage
<arch-center-regional-outage>` by automatically rerouting traffic to a
node in another region for continuous availability and a
smooth user experience. Multi-region deployments can also enhance
performance and can help meet
compliance requirements for :ref:`data sovereignty
<arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`.

A multi-region deployment may have multiple regions within the same geography 
(a large area like a continent or country), single regions in multiple 
geographies, or multiple regions in multiple geographies.

Multi-region deployments can exist with a single cloud provider or 
multiple cloud providers. To learn about multi-cloud deployments, see 
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

To learn how to configure multi-region deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see 
:atlas:`Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/>` in the {+service+}
documentation.

Use Cases for Multi-Region Deployments
--------------------------------------
Consider the 3 use cases in the following image:

   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: An image showing three types of multi-region deployments

In the first example, you have an application that has users 
primarily located in the US. You create a multi-region deployment
in three regions within the US. This ensures low latency, since all regions are 
within the US, while also offering high availability if there's a regional 
outage on one of the nodes (for example, ``us-east-1``).

In the second example, your application requires low latency and high availability 
for users in both the US and Europe. You create a multi-region deployment with 
a region located in both the US and Europe.

The most complex example of a multi-region deployment has multiple regions in 
multiple geographies, ensures the highest level of availability with a single 
provider. If your application requires the very highest level of availability 
and lowest latency, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

Considerations for Multi-Region Deployments
-------------------------------------------

Other considerations for multi-region deployments include:

- High availability depends on the deployment of nodes across
  regions as well as the number, distribution, and priority order of
  nodes. To learn more about recommended
  {+cluster+} topologies for high availability, see
  :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.
- Multi-region deployments are available only for ``M10`` dedicated
  {+clusters+} and larger.
- High availability and low latency also depend on where you deploy 
  your application. When optimizing for availability and latency, plan the 
  deployment of your entire application stack, not just the database.

For more considerations, see 
:atlas:`Considerations 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#considerations>` in the
{+service+} documentation.
