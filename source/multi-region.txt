Multi-region {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} nodes across
multiple regions (as defined by the cloud providers). Multi-region
deployments enhance protection in the case of a :ref:`regional outage
<arch-center-regional-outage>` by automatically rerouting traffic to a
node in another region for continuous availability and a
smooth user experience. Multi-region deployments can also enhance
performance and can help meet
compliance requirements for :ref:`data sovereignty
<arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`.

A multi-region deployment may have multiple regions within the same geography 
(a large area like a continent or country), single regions in multiple 
geographies, or multiple regions in multiple geographies.

Multi-region deployments can exist with a single cloud provider or 
multiple cloud providers. To learn about multi-cloud deployments, see 
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

The following diagram shows a multi-region, single-cloud {+service+}
deployment for regions that support availability zones:

To learn how to configure multi-region deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see 
:atlas:`Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/>` in the {+service+}
documentation.

Use Cases for Multi-Region Deployments
--------------------------------------

To improve performance for critical operations, you can deploy your data close 
to your users' geographic location, which reduces latency. While you can use a 
single-region deployment for this purpose, deploying to a single region 
risks high availability if there is a regional outage. 

A multi-region deployment ensures both high availability and low latency.

If your an application is deployed with |aws| with users
primarily located in the US, you can create a multi-region deployment
in three regions within the US (such as ``us-east-1``, ``us-east-2``,
and ``us-west-2``). This ensures low latency, since all regions are within the 
US, while also offering high availability if there's a regional outage on one 
of the nodes (for example, ``us-east-1``).

If your application requires low latency and high availability for users in 
many geographies, create a multi-region deployment with one or more regions 
located within the multiple geographies that make the most sense for your users' 
locations.

The most complex multi-region deployment, with multiple regions in multiple 
geographies, ensures the very highest level of availability and lowest latency 
that you can achieve with a single provider. 

If your application requires the highest level of availability and lowest latency,
consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

Data Sovereignty and High Availability Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For compliance with data residency laws, data can be partitioned to
reside in specific regions, ensuring adherence to local regulations.
However, deploying to a single region sacrifices high availability if
there is a regional outage. 

You can configure a multi-region for both high availability and data sovereignty.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| that requires data
storage in Europe, you can deploy a multi-region deployment
to three regions within the EU (such as ``eu-west-1``,
``eu-west-2``, and ``eu-west-3``). This ensures data sovereignty since all 
regions are within the EU, while offering high availability if there's a 
regional outage that affects one of the nodes.

If your application requires data sovereignty but doesn't require
cross-region high availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`.

Considerations for Multi-Region Deployments
-------------------------------------------

Other considerations for multi-region deployments include:

- High availability depends on the deployment of nodes across
  regions as well as the number, distribution, and priority order of
  nodes. To learn more about recommended
  {+cluster+} topologies for high availability, see
  :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.
- Multi-region deployments are available only for ``M10`` dedicated
  {+clusters+} and larger.
- High availability also depends on how and where you deploy your application.

For more considerations, see 
:atlas:`Considerations 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#considerations>` in the
{+service+} documentation.
